### What is Dwolla?
[Dwolla](https://www.dwolla.com/) is a payment network that allows any business or person to send, request and accept money. Dwolla is not like those other big payment companies that rely on plastic cards and charge hefty fees. Instead, Dwolla built its own network that securely connects to your bank account and allows you to move money for just **$0.25 per transaction** or **free for transactions $10 or less**.
